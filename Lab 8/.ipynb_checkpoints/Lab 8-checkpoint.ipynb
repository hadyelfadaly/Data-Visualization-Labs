    "# AI vs Machine Learning Vs Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI is the broad concept of making machines intelligent, mimic human intelligence through a set of algorithms. The field focuses on three skills: learning, reasoning, and self-correction to obtain maximum efficiency.\n",
    "- Machine Learning is a subset of AI, uses algorithms that learn from data to make predictions.\n",
    "- Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to process and analyze information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Machine Learning Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data. It is generally categorized into two main types:\n",
    "   - Classification where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories\n",
    "   - Regression where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values.\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering.\n",
    "3. Semi-supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "4. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and output, meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes. This relationship is represented by a straight line.\n",
    "- best-fit line is the straight line that most accurately represents the relationship between the independent variable (input) and the dependent variable (output). The goal of the best line is to minimize the difference between the actual data points and the predicted values from the model.\n",
    "- Multiple linear regression generalizes the case of one predictor to several predictors (more than on independent variable)\n",
    "- Formula for best fit line is: Y = b0 + b1X or Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + b3X3 + ....\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation of Mean Response\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fitted regression line can be used to estimate the mean value of y for a given value of x.\n",
    "- b1 is the slope\n",
    "- b1 = n∑xy−∑x∑y / n∑(x)2−(∑x)2\n",
    "- This formula tells us: How much y changes when x increases by 1 unit\n",
    "- b0 is the point estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "# K-Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "\n",
    "- It works bby finding the \"k\" closest data points (neighbors) to a give input and makes a predictions based on the majority class\n",
    "- Its also called lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the entire dataset and performs computations only at the time of classification.\n",
    "- It uses distance metrics to identify nearest neighbor, like Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Distance"

    "## What is Feature Scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Data Processing, we try to change the data in such a way that the model can process it without any problems. Feature Scaling is one such process in which we transform the data into a better version.\n",
    "- Feature Scaling is done to normalize the features in the dataset into a finite range.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Feature Scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real Life Datasets have many features with a wide range of values, Many machine learning algorithms that are using Euclidean distance as a metric to calculate the similarities will fail to give a reasonable recognition\n",
    "to the smaller featur which in the real case can turn out to be an actually important metric.\n",
    "- KNN doesn’t know which feature is important. It only knows which numbers are bigger. Bigger numbers dominate the distance unless you scale.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization is a scaling method where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero, and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.\n",
    "- Scaling is done by mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "- Use Case: Models that assume or exploit normality and variance structure, like linear/logistic regression, SVMs, and PCA.\n",
    "- Scale Not bounded\n",

    "- Use when you need 0-1 range and Features originally have very different scales and want to keep relative distances\n",
    "- Avoid When Outliers present and you require robustness to future unseen values that may fall outside the min/max\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mean Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use when You want features centered at 0 but still scaled by their range instead of variance\n",

    "\n",
    "## Max Absolute Scaler\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use when Data is already centered at or near 0 and may be sparse\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use when You want features on a comparable scale for distance/gradient‑based models but do not want to trim outliers.\n",

    "# Data Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- A widely adopted technique for dealing with highly unbalanced datasets is called resampling. It consists of removing samples from the majority class (under-sampling) and / or adding more examples from the minority class (over-sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Imbalanced datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced datasets are those where there is a severe skew in the class distribution, such as 1:100 or 1:1000 examples in the minority class to the majority class.\n",
    "- This bias in the training dataset can influence many machine learning algorithms, leading some to ignore the minority class entirely. This is a problem as it is typically the minority class on which predictions are most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Under-Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aims to balance class distribution by randomly eliminating majority class examples. This is done until the majority and minority class instances are balanced out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages \n",
    "\n",
    "- It can help improve run time and storage problems by reducing the number of training data samples when the training data set is huge.It can help improve run time and storage problems by reducing the number of training data samples when the training data set is huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can discard potentially useful information which could be important for building rule classifiers. The sample chosen by random under sampling may be a biased sample. And it will not be an accurate representative of the population. Thereby, resulting in inaccurate results with the actual test data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Over-Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increases the number of instances in the minority class by randomly replicating them to present a higher representation of the minority class in the sample.\n",

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike under sampling this method leads to no information loss. Outperforms under sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- It increases the likelihood of over-fitting since it replicates the minority class events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This technique is followed to avoid over-fitting which occurs when exact replicas of minority instances are added to the main data set. A subset of data is taken from the minority class as an example and then new synthetic similar instances are created. These synthetic instances are then added to the original datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mitigates the problem of over-fitting caused by random oversampling as synthetic examples are generated rather than replication of instances. Also there is no loss of useful information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- While generating synthetic examples SMOTE does not take into consideration neighboring examples from other classes. This can result in increase in overlapping of classes and can introduce additional noise."
