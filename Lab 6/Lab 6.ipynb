    "# 1- Structured data: This type of data is usually composed of numbers or words. They are usually stored in Relational databases\n",
    "# 2- Unstructured data: Including texts, images, videos, speech/audio, and so on.\n",
    "# 3- Semi-structured: Use of metadata or tags that provide additional information about the data elements. For example (XML)\n",

    "#Types of data\n",
    "# 1- Numeric/Quantitative data -> Discrete or continous\n",
    "# Discrete: Data takes on discrete values or whole numbers i.e. numbers without decimal points\n",
    "# Continuous: Data takes on integer values i.e. numbers with decimal values.\n",
    "# 2- Categorical/Qualitative data: This encompasses data that can be represented through words. It usually defines groups or categories. -> oridnal or nominal\n",
    "# Ordinal: This type of data has an inherent ordering present within the categories.\n",
    "# Nominal: This type of data has categories that don’t have any particular order or ranking associated with them. The total number of categories is usually finite in this type of data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Formats\n",
    "# 1- Tabular data: The tabular data consists of multiple features/columns with each of them having a particular data type.\n",
    "# 2- Time series data: Time series data consists of data points that are indexed at specific points in time."

    "# 1- Real data could be dirty and could drive to the extraction of useless patterns/rules. (Incomplete data, data with noise, inconsistent data)\n",
